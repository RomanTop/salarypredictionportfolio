# Salary Predictions Based on Job Descriptions
Salary Prediction Project (Python).
Exploring a set of job postings with salaries and then building a model to predict salaries for new job postings.
## Introduction
This project is dedicated to analysis of job postings in order to:
1.	explore relationship between attributes of a job posting and a salary for this position,
2.	based on the results of the exploration find out if salary for each job posting can be predicted and if it is possible build a model that predicts a target with a certain accuracy.

The data set is provided in two csv files 'train_features.csv' which contains attributes of each job posting and 'train_salaries.csvâ€™ that has salaries for each corresponding job posting.

The head of the data set with job postings attributes has the following format:

The head of the data set contains salaries of the job postings looks like this:

For the future operations with the data I combined two data sets into a one performing inner join using jobID as a Foreign key.
